# 📚 Java Lab Activities Collection  
This repository contains a series of Java-based activities demonstrating the progression from basic console applications to more advanced GUI 
and event-driven programs. Each folder corresponds to a unique lab exercise designed to reinforce foundational and intermediate Java concepts.

---

## 📁 LabActivity1EmployeeInformationSystem
A simple console application that collects an employee’s name, age, hours worked, and hourly wage. It calculates and displays the employee’s 
daily salary using basic input handling and arithmetic operations.

---

## 📁 LabActivity2EmployeeInformationSystemPart2
An enhanced version of the Lab Activity 1. It introduces additional salary computations (weekly, monthly, yearly), retirement gap calculation, 
use of the `Math` and `String` classes, and cleaner data formatting.

---

## 📁 LabActivity3ConditionalStatement  
This program adds structured decision-making to an employee information system using `if-else` and `switch` statements. It validates user inputs 
such as age, work hours, and role codes, and calculates salary breakdowns and retirement eligibility while applying conditional logic to adjust yearly 
net wages. It introduces clear control flow, exception handling through termination conditions, and reinforces the use of branching logic in real-world scenarios.

## 📁 LabActivity4EmpInfoSystemGUI
A GUI-based employee information system built using the AWT library. It allows users to input personal and work-related data through interactive fields, 
validates entries, and displays results in a read-only output area.

---

## 📁 LabActivity5QuizAppAWT
A multiple-choice quiz application that uses AWT components such as `CheckboxGroup`, `Button`, and `Label`. It handles question navigation, scoring, 
and input validation in an intuitive interface driven by event listeners.

---

## 📁 LabActivity6SwingToDoList
A task management tool built with Java Swing. Users can add tasks through a form dialog and view them in a non-editable table. It demonstrates `JFrame`,
`JTable`, `JTextArea`, and custom dialog validation for task entry.

---

## 📁 MyMidtermLabExam
A console-based IT ticketing system that allows users to add, update, and view tickets with basic reporting. It showcases switch-case flow, input handling 
with arrays, simple data validation, and modular method design.

---

## 📁 MyFinalsLabExam
This Java Swing program implements a modern-style calculator with custom-styled buttons and a fully interactive GUI. It supports core operations (add, subtract, 
multiply, divide) and extended functions like square root, square, percentage, and negation.
